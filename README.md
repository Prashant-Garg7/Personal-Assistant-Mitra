## Approach:
### **File Handling:** Used to store and retrieve data, such as maintaining logs of executed commands.
### System Calls (Windows API): The assistant interacts with the operating system using functions like system(), allowing it to open applications, websites, and manage system tasks.
### String Manipulation: Processes and analyzes user input to match it with predefined commands.(strcmp)
### Conditional Statements & Loops: Used for command execution flow and keeping the assistant running in a loop.(if-else statement)
### External Library Integration (eSpeak): Enables text-to-speech conversion, making the assistant capable of voice responses.
